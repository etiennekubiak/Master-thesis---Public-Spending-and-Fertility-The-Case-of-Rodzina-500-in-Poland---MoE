## Abstract
This Master’s thesis investigates the impact of the "Rodzina 500+" policy on fertility rates in Poland.  
The study employs rigorous econometric methods, including Synthetic Control, Difference-in-Differences (DiD), and Event Study approaches to analyze the effects of the policy.

## Methodology
- **Synthetic Control Method**: Constructs a weighted combination of control regions to estimate the counterfactual fertility trend.  
- **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**: Compares the changes in fertility rates before and after the policy between treated and control groups.  
- **Event Study**: Examines the dynamic effects of the policy over time.
