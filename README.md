## Abstract
This Master’s thesis investigates the impact of the "Rodzina 500+" policy on fertility rates in Poland.  
The study employs rigorous econometric methods, including Synthetic Control, Difference-in-Differences (DiD), and Event Study approaches to analyze the effects of the policy.

## Methodology
- **Synthetic Control Method**: Constructs a weighted combination of control regions to estimate the counterfactual fertility trend.  
- **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**: Compares the changes in fertility rates before and after the policy between treated and control groups.  
- **Event Study**: Examines the dynamic effects of the policy over time.

## Main Results
The analysis reveals temporary (short-term) effects on fertility, with an observable increase in birth rates one year after the policy’s introduction, followed by a reversion to pre-policy trends. No substantial quantum effect—that is, no sustained long-term increase in fertility—was detected. These findings are consistent with existing literature on family allowance policies, which often produce short-lived demographic responses rather than structural changes in fertility behavior
